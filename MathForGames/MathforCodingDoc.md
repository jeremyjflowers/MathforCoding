## I. Requirements

1. Description of Project

	- **Name**: MathforGames Assessment

	- **Project Instruction**:
	Create an application or a game program that demostrates the techinques of raylib in C# and a math library.

	- **Problem Specification**:
    An interactive application that highlights the usefulness of your maths
classes by performing transformations within a graphical Test Application. This graphical application
must make use of your math classes to transform and display items using a matrix hierarchy to correctly
display visual elements, such as icons on the screen or sprite characters.

2. Input Information
- Up Arrow Key - Allows the player to move upwards
- Down Arrow Key - Allows the player to move downwards
- Right Arrow Key - Allows the player to move towards the right
- Left Arrow Key - Allows the player to move towards the left
- Spacebar Key - Enables the player to shoot
